4. Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).

Why Python is used:
Python's convenience has made it the most popular language for machine learning and artificial intelligence. Python's flexibility has allowed Anyscale to make ML/AI scalable from laptops to clusters.
